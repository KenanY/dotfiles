# dotfiles

My dotfiles for an ArchLinux system.

## Installation

Frankly, you shouldn't use these as they are. They are tailored specifically for
me, and I bet we don't even have the same shoe size, much less the same
preferences for a development environment. Instead, what you should do is fork
this repository, and read through the files carefully and understand each piece,
changing it to suit your personal needs. Remove anything you won't use or don't
understand.
